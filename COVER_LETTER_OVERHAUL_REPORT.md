## Usage Examples

### With OpenAI API Key
```python
# Analysis provides real AI feedback
{
  "overall_score": 87,
  "job_alignment_score": 82,
  "ats_score": 90,
  "strengths": ["Specific achievements with quantifiable results", "..."],
  "weaknesses": ["Could strengthen opening paragraph", "..."],
  "keyword_analysis": {"missing_keywords": [...], "suggestions": "..."},
  "ai_powered": true
}
```

### Without OpenAI API Key
```python
# Intelligent fallback analysis
